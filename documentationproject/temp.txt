iOS Jailbreak Documentation

Introduction:
iOS and iPadOS devices by Apple have proven to be very popular due to their ease of use, stability, and streamlined experience. For many people, this is acceptable; they just want their device to work as expected every time. However, for those that want to use their devices to the limits and express their creativity, Apple devices are quite limiting. Luckily, there is a solution: jailbreaking!

Jailbreaking refers to gaining an elvated level of privilege on a system, or in other words, do things normally not allowed by the manufacturer/developers/etc. Jailbreaking is not unique to Apple devices, just about every system imaginable has been hacked in some way. Different terms can be used, such as "rooting" on Android or "homebrewing" on video game consoles, but it is the same concept either way.

What you should already know:
This guide assumes you have the following basic background:
	-Knowing how to backup your device using a computer.
	-Knowing how to DFU restore in the event of a bootloop.

Is jailbreaking illegal or dangerous?
A common misconception of jailbreaking is that it is illegal. However, in the U.S., the US Copyright Office declared jailbreaking to be an exception to the Digital Millennium Copyright Act. Of course, it is possible to do illegal things with jailbreaking, however even just a web browser can allow one to do illegal things.

Another common misconception is that jailbreaking is dangerous. Jailbreaking by itself is very safe, and with proper procedures and common sense, one will not have issues with jailbreaking.
